# Discharged
An original Zeldalike 2D game I'm working on for the New Nintendo 3DS

What's the game about?

Lightning Storm: Discharged is an original game developed by Red Lightning Studios for the Nintendo 3DS. The game is a cross between a top down 2D Zelda like dungeon game and a traditional 2D side scrolling game. You will go through each level collecting different items, defeating enemies, solving puzzles and defeating a boss each chapter. I haven't decided how many chapters I will make, it depends how successful the game becomes. The items you collect will be mostly optional however they will make you journey much easier for example giving you extra health, dealing extra damage or a farther reach distance.
