# Discharged
An original Zeldalike 2D game I'm working on for the New Nintendo 3DS

What's the game about?

Lightning Storm: Discharged is an original singeplayer game developed by Red Lightning Studios for the Nintendo 3DS. The game is a cross between a top down 2D Zelda like dungeon game and a traditional 2D side scrolling game. You will go through each level collecting different items, defeating enemies, solving puzzles and defeating a boss each chapter. I haven't decided how many chapters I will make, it depends how successful the game becomes. The items you collect will be mostly optional however they will make you journey much easier for example giving you extra health, dealing extra damage or a farther reach distance.

The game follows 7 characters (names still to be decided) which are the protectors of the island of Raitoni. The island is powered by the Raitonium crystals found only on the island which generate immense power. These crystals were stolen by the evil Perplexor and his pals and now the island relies on YOU to retrieve them and save the day. Each level has one crystal to reward you for beating it which will power another part of the island giving you access to the next level's portal. Scattered around the levels are Raitonium Shards which can be used to create a Raitonium crystal incase you can't beat a level. Can you find them all?

Each character has different stats which can better suit your playstyle. Some have more strength dealing more damage, others have more speed to dodge the enemies, others have more endurance to take more hits. There's even a character that has everything set to the minimum for all of those who enjoy a good challenge.

The game is still heavily under development and bugs are to be expected and everything is subject to change. This game wouldn't be here without the support from everyone so your feedback is important to me so if you have any please contact me on my discord (listed under the links).

I would love to make a PC Version and someday I plan to investigate this idea further but for now the game is too early into development and I'd rather wait until I have something more completed before looking into this. So currently the 3ds is the only platform supported. And most of the releases only support "New" 3ds because of some technical difficulties with the old 3ds. I don't know why it crashes on o3ds hardware but it does. If anyone can help me I'd be more than happy to support o3ds completely.

Multiplayer has some ideas tossed around but I have no idea how I'd make that so it most likely will not be added. Singeplayer is the main focus currently.

The game is made by Red Lightning Studios (me). I am the only developer currently, anyone else claiming to be a developer is spreading false information.
All the music and most of the art is made by Red Lightning Studios (me again). tytoyXD helps with the designs for some of the art so it's not all me with that.
